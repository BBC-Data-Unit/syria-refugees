More than 17,000 refugees fleeing the conflict in Syria have come to the UK under the Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme.

BBC News caught up with some of them to share their stories about life in the UK.

The England data unit also analysed the latest figures to show how many people have gone to each region and local authority area.

This repo includes some charts that were not used in the story.
